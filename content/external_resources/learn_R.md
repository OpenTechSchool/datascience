* [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/): Swirl is an R package that allows you to learn R interactively in the R console.  

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) from Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham: An excellent introduction to data science via R by two heavyweights of the R community, it is broken down into 5 parts, corresponding to steps in the data science process: Explore, Wrangle, Program, Model, and Communicate. You'll learn the "tidy" approach to data, and immediately use libraries such as `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`. Some basic knowledge of R can be helpful, but isn't absolutely necessary. It's also available as a book.

* [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) from Hadley Wickham: A companion website to the book of the same name, it introduces more advanced features (and quirks) of the R language, e.g. style, exception handling, functional programming, R's C interface, etc.

* [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science): A comprehensive, challenging, 10-part course from Johns Hopkins University & Coursera. Covers R, the data science workflow, stats, and some machine learning.

* [R Tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/): A basic intro to R and stats from the University of Georgia, Department of Mathematics.

* [Sharp Sight Labs](https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/): A useful blog with short tutorials on the nuts and bolts of data analysis in R, with a focus on tidyverse tools and on developing fluency.

* [The Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-3): Semester-long course from MIT & edX. Covers stats/DS using real-world examples.

* [Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/): A website dedicated to helping individuals with some background in statistics transition to R.
