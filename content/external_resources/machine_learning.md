## Tutorials, R and Python
* [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) _(Py)_:  An excellent introduction to applied ML from Udacity. The course focuses on the ML library [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). Part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, it takes an estimated 10 weeks to complete.

* [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) _(Py)_: A popular introduction to the theory behind common ML algorithms, from Coursera founder and Stanford professor Andrew Ng. It takes an estimated 11 weeks to complete. A certificate is available for Coursera subscribers, but the material is free for everyone. Use of Octave/Matlab in only required when pursuing a certificate.

* [Chris Albon's personal website](https://chrisalbon.com) - Lots of short tutorials. Mostly ML, but also web scraping, regular expressions, visualization, etc. Chris has also written a [book](https://www.amazon.de/dp/1491989386/).

* [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/): An online version of the popular deep learning textbook.

* [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/): Free online version of the popular NLP book. Uses NLTK. Updated for Python 3.

* [Kaggle Titanic Tutorial](http://trevorstephens.com/kaggle-titanic-tutorial/getting-started-with-r/) _(R)_: A tutorial aimed at Kaggle's [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Begins with some basics, then moves on to decision trees, feature engineering, and random forests.

* [Kaggle Titanic Tutorial](https://blog.socialcops.com/engineering/machine-learning-python/) _(Py)_: Machine learning with scikit-learn and tensorflow

* [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) from Jason Brownlee _(R/Python)_: Includes lots of self-study tutorials covering beginner to advanced topics in machine learning and statistics. Brownlee also offers some ebooks for $37-47, in case you're looking for more depth and/or structure.

* [fast.ai](http://fast.ai): A website dedicated to making the power of deep learning accessible to all.



## Toolkits

* [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) _(Py)_: Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts. Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. Open source, commercially usable - BSD license.

* [Keras](https://keras.io/) _(Py)_: A Python deep learning library. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) _(Py)_: An open source machine learning framework.

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) _(Py)_: A deep learning framework for fast, flexible experimentation.

* [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/) _(Py)_: NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.


* [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) _(R)_: The caret package (short for _C_lassification _A_nd _RE_gression _T_raining) is a set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models.

* [class](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/class/versions/7.3-14) _(R)_: Various functions for classification, including k-nearest neighbour, Learning Vector Quantization and Self-Organizing Maps.

* [stats](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html) _(R)_: Offers a number of functions for supervised and unsupervised learning.
