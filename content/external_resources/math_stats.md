* [Statistics with R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics): A popular, semester-long statistics course from from Duke University & Coursera. Focus is on stats with programming assignments in R. That said,Â it is possible to make it through the course without knowing much about R. Topics: inference, correlation, regression, Bayesian statistics.

* [Computational Linear Algebra for Coders](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/blob/master/README.md): From the good people at [fast.ai](http://fast.ai).

* [Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers](https://www.edx.org/course/laff-linear-algebra-foundations-to-frontiers): A popular, semester-long course from the University of Texas at Austin and edX. Challenging, but doesn't assume too much math experience. Programming exercises require Matlab, but it's possible to finish the course with R, Python, etc.
