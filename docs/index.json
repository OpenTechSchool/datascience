	"content": " Swirl: Swirl is an R package that allows you to learn R interactively in the R console.\n Introduction to R from DataCamp: A solid, 6-part intro to the basics of the R language with 4-5 hours of material. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in continuing with DataCamp you can purchase a subscription for 22€ per month, which gives you access to 137 courses (R and Python) and a number of career and skill tracks.\n DataCamp Community Tutorials: Lots of tutorials, many user-created. Lots of R, but also Python, SQL, Git, stats, etc.\n R for Data Science from Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham: An excellent introduction to data science via R by two heavyweights of the R community, it is broken down into 5 parts, corresponding to steps in the data science process: Explore, Wrangle, Program, Model, and Communicate. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn the \u0026ldquo;tidy\u0026rdquo; approach to data, and immediately use libraries such as dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. Some basic knowledge of R can be helpful, but isn\u0026rsquo;t absolutely necessary (DataCamp\u0026rsquo;s intro is more than enough). It\u0026rsquo;s also available as a book.\n Advanced R from Hadley Wickham: A companion website to the book of the same name, it introduces more advanced features (and quirks) of the R language, e.g. style, exception handling, functional programming, R\u0026rsquo;s C interface, etc.\n Data Science Specialization: A comprehensive, challenging, 10-part course from Johns Hopkins University \u0026amp; Coursera. Covers R, the data science workflow, stats, and some machine learning.\n R Tutorial: A basic intro to R and stats from the University of Georgia, Department of Mathematics.\n Sharp Sight Labs: A useful blog with short tutorials on the nuts and bolts of data analysis in R, with a focus on tidyverse tools and on developing fluency.\n The Analytics Edge: Semester-long course from MIT \u0026amp; edX. Covers stats/DS using real-world examples.\n Quick-R: A website dedicated to helping individuals with some background in statistics transition to R.\n  "

Klein also offers quite a bit beyond the core material, e.g. Advanced Topics, Numerical Python, Machine Learning, and Tkinter Tutorial. All the material is offered in English and German.\n DataCamp Community Tutorials: Lots of tutorials, many user-created. Lots of Python, but also R, SQL, Git, stats, etc.\n Introduction to Data Processing with Python from OTS: A work in progress, our own tutorial builds on the foundations of Introduction to Programming with Python. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to install and use Jupyter notebooks, load data, analyze a survey, and visualize your data. We\u0026rsquo;ve got quite a bit in the pipeline, so be sure to check back soon.\n Pandas Tutorial: This tutorial consists of a series of Jupyter Notebooks introducing the fundamentals of the Pandas module. The notebooks can be freely downloaded. The Pandas tutorial, as well as tutorials on a number of other data science related topics, are also available as email courses.\n StatsModels Tutorial: Repo of Jupyter Notebooks dealing with the StatsModels module. The material is a little old and not very well organized, but there are still a few gems there for anyone doing statistics in Python.\n SciPy Lecture Notes: A brief (1-2 hours per module) introduction to the tools and techniques of Python\u0026rsquo;s SciPy module.\n CS109 Data Science: A very comprehensive, very challenging course from Harvard\u0026rsquo;s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Uses Python.\n  "
